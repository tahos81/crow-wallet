## Overview

Exploration of utilizing [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) to designate an experimental Delegation Contract (with basic P256 Authorization & Batch Call capabilities) onto an EOA. This experiment also leverages a Sequencer to [enable sponsored transactions](https://ithaca.xyz/writings/orc-0001) via an `odyssey_sendTransaction` RPC method.
